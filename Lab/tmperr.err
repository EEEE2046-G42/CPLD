INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'Clock' based upon the LOC
   constraint 'P44'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly
   in your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG
   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be
   ignored.
WARNING:Cpld:1007 - Removing unused input(s) 'Clock'.  The input(s) are unused
   after optimization. Please verify functionality via simulation.
ERROR:Cpld:1248 - DRC error: too many Asynchronous Set/Resets (AP/AR) in design.
   At least 6 function blocks are required to implement them, only 4 are
   available in this device.
ERROR:Cpld:1064 - Design rules checking error. Fitting process stopped.
ERROR:Cpld:868 - Cannot fit the design into any of the specified devices with
